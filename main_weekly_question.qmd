# Response to Questions

```{python}

import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
# host = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'
# path = '~jreades/data'
# file = '2022-09-10-listings.csv.gz'
# url  = f'{host}/{path}/{file}'

# if os.path.exists(os.pathdatafile):
#   df = pd.read_csv(file, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
# else: 
#   df = pd.read_csv(url, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
#   df.to_csv(file)

```{python}
# Read file in the data folder. The file is extracted from insideairbnb.com on Nov 13, 2023

df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join('data','listings.csv.gz'), compression='gzip', low_memory=False)

## 1. Who collected the data?

Inside Airbnb was founded by Murray Cox who conceived the project, and keeps updating and analyzing Airbnb data (*About Inside Airbnb*, no date). 
 

## 2. Why did they collect it?

Murray Cox and his partners aim to make Airbnb's data more transparent and accessible to the public. In addition to making visual dashboards of different cities, they also wrote many reports based on these data. For example, they criticized Airbnb’s New York data as misleading (Cox and Slee, 2016). 

For consumers, they can understand market trends more easily, which help them make more informed decisions and choose accommodation that fits their needs and budget; For landlords, transparency of information will promote fair competition, and maintain the stability of short-term rental market prices; For academics, they can use these data to explore how Airbnb relates to many factors in urban development; For the government, they can understand the current situation of the short-term rental market and try to control the phenomenon that is not conducive to the stable development of the city by establishing more supervision regulation.

```{python}
print(f"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]:,}")
```

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```

## 3. How was the data collected?  

Inside Airbnb uses web scraping scripts to extract publicly available information from Airbnb's website on a quarterly basis. These scripts navigate the Airbnb site, accessing various pages to retrieve data such as listing titles, descriptions, hosts, pricing, and more. The collected data is then verified, cleaned, and made available on the Inside Airbnb website for users to explore online or download for analysis.

In addition to providing a snapshot, Inside Airbnb conducts in-depth analyses using this raw data to derive more insightful information for users. For instance, the platform employs a proprietary "San Francisco Model" to estimate the frequency with which an Airbnb listing is rented out and to approximate a listing's income.

## 4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness and/or accuracy of its representation of the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?

1. Pricing and availability among others are extremely dynamic attributes set by hosts that cannot be captured accurately with webscraping, which only reflects a snapshot of the website at one specific moment in time.
2. Susceptible to changes in the structure of the website.
3. Web scraping only accesses pubicly available listings.
4. Too frequent web scraping may affect site performance which in turns affect the data scraped
5. Has to ethical and legal implications
6. Data capture can only capture real-time airbnb data, and long-term comparative analysis requires data collection in advance

## 5. What ethical considerations does the use of this data raise? 

First, Airbnb is a profitable company, making their data public without interfering with normal operations makes it easier to regulate them. But as landlords and renters, they have the right to request that their personal information not be made public elsewhere. However, it is not possible to ask everyone’s consent when the data is crawled. Therefore, using this data may be needed to handle sensitive personal information. Second, as the data is simply extracted and shown, users can only see the surface and cannot understand the context and logic of it. It may cause inaccuracies usage of data, which can be misused and misguide public opinion (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020). For example, the rental activities of a particular group may be negatively analyzed, which will reinforce the stereotype of this group and then trigger discrimination and antagonism mood of society. Third, data settings are always influenced by power (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020). Airbnb often leaves out reviews that aren’t friendly to properties and focuses on those that are profitable, such as setting its recommendation algorithm to favour partners. Therefore, users need to be fair when using such data. Moreover, for the community, inside Airbnb, which aggregates Airbnb property data, gives an insight into the characteristics of neighbourhoods, such as the community’s entire pool of guests, which may be revealed. This could have implications for home privacy and home security.

## 6. With reference to the data (*i.e.* using numbers, figures, maps, and descriptive statistics), what does an analysis of Hosts and Listing types suggest about the nature of Airbnb lets in London? 

research question: The airbnb listings types have the impact on crime types
The airbnb listings are divided into three types: Shared room, Private room, Entire home/apt (explain why we do this classification)
The crime is divided into two types: ?? (explain why we do this classification)

1、two types of crime 
    -each type of crime 
    -the frequency (histogram)
    -the distribution of each area () 
2、three types of airbnb listings
    -statistic 
    -the frequency (histogram)
    -the distribution
3、relationship
    -compare the different frequency of crime types of different airbnb listings
    -
    -scatter
    -correlation matrix

## 7. Drawing on your previous answers, and supporting your response with evidence (e.g. figures, maps, and statistical analysis/models), how *could* this data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London?
