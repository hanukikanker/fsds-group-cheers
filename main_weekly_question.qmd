# Response to Questions

```{python}
import os
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
# host = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'
# path = '~jreades/data'
# file = '2022-09-10-listings.csv.gz'
# url  = f'{host}/{path}/{file}'

# if os.path.exists(os.pathdatafile):
#   df = pd.read_csv(file, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
# else: 
#   df = pd.read_csv(url, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
#   df.to_csv(file)
```

```{python}
# Read file in the data folder. The file is extracted from insideairbnb.com on Nov 13, 2023

df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join('data','listings.csv.gz'), compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
```

## 1. Who collected the data?

Inside Airbnb was founded by Murray Cox, an artist, activist and technologist who conceived the project, compiled and analyzed the data and built the site. @insideairbnb
 

## 2. Why did they collect it?

- To increase transparency about Airbnb. Inside Airbnb wants to make it easier for people to understand how Airbnb is affecting their communities.
- To hold Airbnb accountable for its impact. Inside Airbnb wants Airbnb to be more transparent about its data and to take steps to mitigate the negative impacts of its busines
- 
To promote responsible short-term rentals. Inside Airbnb believes that short-term rentals can be a positive thing for communities, but it believes that they need to be regulated to ensure that they are not harming local residen.

```{python}
print(f"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]:,}")
```

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```

## 3. How was the data collected?  

Inside Airbnb uses web scraping scripts to extract publicly available information from Airbnb's website on a quarterly basis. These scripts go through the Airbnb site, access pages, and get data such as listing titles, descriptions, hosts, pricing, etc. The collected data is then verified, cleaned, and made available on the Inside Airbnb website for users to explore on the website, or download and analyze. 

Beyond providing a snapshot, InsideAirbnb also conducts deeper analyses with this raw data to derive more insightful data to users. For example, InsideAirbnb also uses a priopriety "San Francisco Model" to estimate how often an Airbnb listing is being rented out and also approximate a listing's income.

## 4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness and/or accuracy of its representation of the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?

1. Pricing and availability among others are extremely dynamic attributes set by hosts that cannot be captured accurately with webscraping, which only reflects a snapshot of the website at one specific moment in time.
2. Susceptible to changes in the structure of the website.
3. Web scraping only accesses pubicly available listings.
4. Too frequent web scraping may affect site performance which in turns affect the data scraped
5. Has to ethical and legal implications
6. Data capture can only capture real-time airbnb data, and long-term comparative analysis requires data collection in advance

## 5. What ethical considerations does the use of this data raise? 

First, Airbnb is a profitable company, making their data public without interfering with normal operations makes it easier to regulate them. But as landlords and renters, they have the right to request that their personal information not be made public elsewhere. However, it is not possible to ask everyone’s consent when the data is crawled. Therefore, using this data may be needed to handle sensitive personal information. Second, as the data is simply extracted and shown, users can only see the surface and cannot understand the context and logic of it. It may cause inaccuracies usage of data, which can be misused and misguide public opinion (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020). For example, the rental activities of a particular group may be negatively analyzed, which will reinforce the stereotype of this group and then trigger discrimination and antagonism mood of society. Third, data settings are always influenced by power (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020). Airbnb often leaves out reviews that aren’t friendly to properties and focuses on those that are profitable, such as setting its recommendation algorithm to favour partners. Therefore, users need to be fair when using such data. Moreover, for the community, inside Airbnb, which aggregates Airbnb property data, gives an insight into the characteristics of neighbourhoods, such as the community’s entire pool of guests, which may be revealed. This could have implications for home privacy and home security.

## 6. With reference to the data (*i.e.* using numbers, figures, maps, and descriptive statistics), what does an analysis of Hosts and Listing types suggest about the nature of Airbnb lets in London?

## 7. Drawing on your previous answers, and supporting your response with evidence (e.g. figures, maps, and statistical analysis/models), how *could* this data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London?
